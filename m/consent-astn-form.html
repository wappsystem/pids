                      Dear Sir/Madam,
                      <br><br>
                      This questionnaire was developed by the Australian Sleep Trials Network and the Cooperative
                      Research Centre (CRC) for Alertness, Safety and Productivity (http://www.alertnesscrc.com/). The
                      CRC is a collaboration between the Australian Government working closely with industry partners
                      and Australia’s top Universities and Research Institutes whose primary aim is to conduct cutting
                      edge, quality research to develop innovative ways to improve sleep health, alertness, safety and
                      productivity for all Australians. This important research is impossible without the generous
                      contribution from volunteers, and as such we would like to invite you to contribute to this
                      research effort designed to better understand and treat sleep disorders. We would be grateful if
                      you would complete the following questionnaire as soon as possible prior to your scheduled sleep
                      study. This questionnaire will take approximately 45 minutes to complete, which can be done in
                      multiple sessions. Please complete all sections unless it states that you are not required to do
                      so.
                      <br><br>
                      Taking part in this research is completely voluntary and all information obtained in this
                      questionnaire will be kept confidential and de-identified prior to any research use. Any research
                      information will be de-identified and stored completely anonymously and separate from your
                      personal information on a CRC database with the same high level of security as your personal
                      medical record. Your information will not be provided to any third party unless required by law.
                      <br><br>
                      If you have any concerns or questions we encourage you to contact our research team on 0x xxxx xxxx
                       as early as possible prior to your study date.
